        <p>
          My journey in programming started in 12th grade when one of lessons in
          school was Programming basics. I don`t remember the name of program we
          used but I really liked it. Sometimes even finished homework during
          class. And did some extra tasks at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did really enjoy it but didn`t go after that dream. Main reason was
          that I was very shy back then. I was really unsure about myself and
          convinced myself that I am not good enough. So life took me in other
          direction and mainly worked as client consultant.
        </p>

          At some points I tried to renew the love for programming with some
          free courses like in codecademy or some tutorials. But there was
          always something else that needed to be done.

          Last two years I am unemployed. I took courses as nail care specialist
          with the help of Riga municipality project.

          But then I found Codelex. Thought for a moment and decided to take
          this chance and finally went after long lost dream of becoming a
          programmer. With the help of mentor I learned programming and now at
          every chance I try to learn something new or improve existing
          knowledge. Take a look at this project for example.
